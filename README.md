# advent-of-code-2022

Going through the Advent of code 2022 using Java. Should be a fun ride. Also I have a blog if you want you
can [check it out here](https://www.codingnagger.com/) or ping me
on [Minds @CodingNagger](https://minds.com/CodingNagger).

## How to run it

```
./mvnw clean compile exec:java
```

## Running tests

```
./mvnw clean test
```

## Cruise log

Last year I ran
a [cruise log for my 25 days competing in the Advent of Code](https://www.codingnagger.com/tag/advent-of-code-2021/) and
decided I would at least try to do the same this year.
However last year, [unlike 2020](https://www.codingnagger.com/tag/advent-of-code-2021/), I gave up after day 21 as too
much of my time was consumed plus I was in Paris with family from the 22nd. I will try to take it a little
further this year.
